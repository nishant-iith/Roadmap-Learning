## Round 4: Case Study
- **Time:** 45-60 min

**Description:** A case study based on a real world data science problem to assess candidate's talent in applying machine learning theory to practice. The candidate shall be assessed on her/his ability to understand data related challenges, modeling and design choices as well as model assessment skills. There is generally no single best solution to such case studies. The interviewer will rather assess the candidate on her/his thought process and on how she/he may fare in a team-working environment.
