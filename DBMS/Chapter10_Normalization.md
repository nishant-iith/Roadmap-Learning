# Chapter 10: Normalization 📋

## What is Normalization? 🤔

**Normalization is a step towards DB optimization** - a systematic approach to organize data in a database efficiently.

Think of normalization like **organizing your messy room**. Instead of throwing everything in one big box, you put similar items together in separate, organized boxes.

**Normalization = Organizing data to avoid confusion and duplication**

## Functional Dependency (FD) 🔗

### Definition
**Functional Dependency is a relationship between the primary key attribute (usually) of the relation to that of the other attribute of the relation.**

**Notation**: `X → Y`
- **X** = **Determinant** (left side of FD)
- **Y** = **Dependent** (right side of FD)

### Simple Definition
**FD tells us: "If I know X, I can figure out Y"**

### Real-Life Examples:
- `Student_ID → Student_Name` (Know student ID → Know name)
- `ISBN → Book_Title` (Know ISBN → Know book title)
- `Email → User_Name` (Know email → Know username)

### Types of Functional Dependencies

#### 1. Trivial FD 🥱
**A → B has trivial functional dependency if B is a subset of A. A→A, B→B are also Trivial FD.**

**Examples**:
- `A → A`
- `B → B`
- `{Student_ID, Name} → Name` (since Name ⊆ {Student_ID, Name})

**Why it's "trivial"**: If you have both ID and name, you obviously know the name!

#### 2. Non-Trivial FD 🚀
**A → B has a non-trivial functional dependency if B is not a subset of A. [A intersection B is NULL].**

**Example**:
- `Student_ID → Student_Name` (Student_Name ∉ {Student_ID})

**Why it's "non-trivial"**: Knowing ID gives you NEW information (name)

---

## Armstrong's Axioms (Rules of FD) 🛠️

These rules help us create new functional dependencies from existing ones.

### 1. Reflexive Rule 🔄
**If 'A' is a set of attributes and 'B' is a subset of 'A'. Then, A→B holds.**
**If A ⊇ B then A → B.**

**Example**:
- `{Student_ID, Name} → Student_ID`
- `{A, B, C} → A` (since A ⊆ {A, B, C})

### 2. Augmentation Rule ➕
**If B can be determined from A, then adding an attribute to this functional dependency won't change anything.**
**If A→B holds, then AX→BX holds too. 'X' being a set of attributes.**

**Example**:
- If `Student_ID → Name`
- Then `{Student_ID, Course} → {Name, Course}`

### 3. Transitivity Rule 🔗
**If A determines B and B determines C, we can say that A determines C.**
**If A→B and B→C then A→C.**

**Example**:
- `Student_ID → Dept_ID`
- `Dept_ID → Dept_Name`
- **Therefore**: `Student_ID → Dept_Name`

## Why Do We Need Normalization? 🎯

### Main Goal
**To avoid redundancy in the DB, not to store redundant data.**

### The Problem: Data Redundancy
Imagine you have this table:

| Student_ID | Name | Course | Professor | Professor_Email |
|------------|------|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| 101        | John | Math   | Dr. Smith | smith@college   |
| 101        | John | Physics| Dr. Smith | smith@college   |
| 102        | Jane | Math   | Dr. Smith | smith@college   |

**Problems here:**
1. **Redundancy**: Dr. Smith's email repeated 3 times
2. **Update Mess**: If Dr. Smith changes email, you must update 3 places
3. **Delete Risk**: If John leaves, you might lose course information
4. **Insert Issue**: Can't add a new course without a student

---

## Database Anomalies 😱

**Anomalies means abnormalities, there are three types of anomalies introduced by data redundancy.**

### 1. Insertion Anomaly 🚫
**When certain data (attribute) cannot be inserted into the DB without the presence of other data.**

**Problem**: Can't add a new course until a student takes it
**Real Example**: Can't add a new professor until they teach a course
**Solution**: Separate course table and professor table

### 2. Deletion Anomaly 💀
**The delete anomaly refers to the situation where the deletion of data results in the unintended loss of some other important data.**

**Problem**: Removing last student from a course deletes course info
**Real Example**: If only one student takes a course and that student leaves, you lose the course information
**Solution**: Keep course data separate from enrollment data

### 3. Updation Anomaly (or Modification Anomaly) 🔄
**The update anomaly is when an update of a single data value requires multiple rows of data to be updated.**
**Due to updation to many places, may be Data inconsistency arises, if one forgets to update the data at all the intended places.**

**Problem**: Professor's email change requires updating many rows
**Real Example**: Professor gets married and changes name - must update in every course they teach
**Risk**: If you miss updating one row, data becomes inconsistent
**Solution**: One place for professor data

### Impact on Database Performance
**Due to these anomalies, DB size increases and DB performance becomes very slow.**

**Solution**: To rectify these anomalies and the effects on DB, we use Database optimization technique called **NORMALIZATION**.

## What is Normalization? 📋

**Normalization is used to minimise the redundancy from relations. It is also used to eliminate undesirable characteristics like Insertion, Update, and Deletion Anomalies.**

**Normalization divides the composite attributes into individual attributes OR larger table into smaller and links them using relationships.**

**The normal form is used to reduce redundancy from the database table.**

## Types of Normal Forms 📊

Think of normal forms like **levels of cleanliness** - each level removes more mess.

### 1NF: First Normal Form 🧹
**Rule**: Every cell must have only ONE value

**Bad (Multi-valued)**:
| Student_ID | Name    | Courses                    |
|------------|---------|----------------------------|
| 101        | John    | [Math, Physics, Chemistry]| ❌

**Good (Atomic values)**:
| Student_ID | Name | Course    |
|------------|------|-----------|
| 101        | John | Math      |
| 101        | John | Physics   |
| 101        | John | Chemistry | ✅

**Key Idea**: No lists or arrays in cells - each box has one item.

---

### 2NF: Second Normal Form 🧹🧹
**Rules**:
1. Must be in 1NF
2. No **partial dependencies**

**What is Partial Dependency?**
When data depends on only **part** of a composite key.

**Problem Example**:
```
Table: Enrollments
Key: {Student_ID, Course_ID}
Data: Student_Name, Grade, Course_Name

❌ Student_Name depends only on Student_ID (partial!)
❌ Course_Name depends only on Course_ID (partial!)
✅ Grade depends on BOTH Student_ID AND Course_ID (full!)
```

**Solution**: Split into separate tables
```
Students:   {Student_ID} → Student_Name
Courses:    {Course_ID} → Course_Name
Enrollments:{Student_ID, Course_ID} → Grade
```

**Key Idea**: Non-key data must depend on the **entire** key, not just part of it.

---

### 3NF: Third Normal Form 🧹🧹🧹
**Rules**:
1. Must be in 2NF
2. No **transitive dependencies**

**What is Transitive Dependency?**
Chain reaction: Key → A → B (where A and B are non-key)

**Problem Example**:
```
Table: Students
Key: Student_ID
Data: Student_Name, Dept_ID, Dept_Name

✅ Student_ID → Dept_ID (OK - key to non-key)
❌ Dept_ID → Dept_Name (BAD - non-key to non-key!)
```

**Solution**: Break the chain
```
Students:    {Student_ID} → Student_Name, Dept_ID
Departments: {Dept_ID} → Dept_Name
```

**Key Idea**: Non-key attributes shouldn't depend on other non-key attributes.

---

### BCNF: Boyce-Codd Normal Form 🏆
**Rules**:
1. Must be in 3NF
2. **Every determinant must be a super key**

**What this means**: If A → B, then A must be a **super key** (can determine ALL columns)

**Problem Example**:
```
Table: Class_Assignments
Data: {Student, Course} → Professor
      Professor → Course

Key: {Student, Course}

❌ Professor → Course violates BCNF
   (Professor is NOT a super key - can't determine Student)
```

**Solution**: Make determinants super keys
```
Table1: {Student, Course} → Professor
Table2: {Professor} → Course     (Professor is now super key here!)
```

**Key Idea**: Anything that determines other data must be able to determine **everything** in the table.

## Quick Normal Form Test 🔍

| Normal Form | Test Question | Fixes |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| **1NF** | "Does any cell have multiple values?" | Repeating groups |
| **2NF** | "Does any data depend on only part of the key?" | Partial dependencies |
| **3NF** | "Does any non-key data depend on other non-key data?" | Transitive dependencies |
| **BCNF** | "Is every determinant a super key?" | Remaining redundancy |

**Memory Trick**:
- **1NF** = One value per cell
- **2NF** = No **P**artial dependencies
- **3NF** = No **T**ransitive dependencies
- **BCNF** = **B**etter than 3NF (every determinant is super key)

## Step-by-Step Example 🎯

### Original Messy Table:
```
Library_Book:
Book_ID | Title | Author_Name | Author_Email | Category | Category_Desc
1       | SQL   | John        | john@email   | DB       | Database
2       | C++   | John        | john@email   | PL       | Programming
3       | Java  | Mary        | mary@email   | PL       | Programming
```

### Problems Found:
1. **Redundancy**: John's info repeated, Programming category repeated
2. **Update**: John changes email → update multiple rows
3. **Insert**: Can't add new author without book
4. **Delete**: Remove all John's books → lose author info

### Step 1: Check 1NF ✅
All cells have single values → Good

### Step 2: Find Dependencies:
```
Book_ID → Title, Author_Name, Author_Email, Category, Category_Desc
Author_Name → Author_Email
Category → Category_Desc
```

### Step 3: Check 2NF
**Primary Key**: Book_ID
**No partial dependencies** (only one attribute in key) → Good

### Step 4: Check 3NF
**Transitive dependencies found**:
```
Book_ID → Author_Name → Author_Email
Book_ID → Category → Category_Desc
```

### Step 5: Normalize to 3NF:
```
Books: {Book_ID} → Title, Author_Name, Category
Authors: {Author_Name} → Author_Email
Categories: {Category} → Category_Desc
```

**Final Result**: Clean, organized, no redundancy! 🎉

## Interview Questions (Simplified) 💼

### Q1: What's the difference between 3NF and BCNF?
**Simple Answer**:
- **3NF**: Removes A→B→C problems (non-prime → non-prime)
- **BCNF**: Even stricter - if A→B, then A must be a super key
- **Example**:
  - 3NF allows: {Student, Course} → Professor, Professor → Office
  - BCNF says: No! Professor must be a super key

### Q2: Should I always normalize to BCNF?
**Simple Answer**:
**No!** Sometimes you denormalize for performance.
- **Normalize**: When data integrity is crucial (banking, user data)
- **Denormalize**: When read speed is crucial (analytics, reporting)

### Q3: Find normal form: R(A,B,C,D) with FDs: {A→B, C→D}
**Step-by-Step**:
1. **Key**: {A, C} (only combination that determines everything)
2. **1NF**: Assume atomic values ✅
3. **2NF**:
   - A→B is partial dependency (A is part of key)
   - **Not in 2NF**
4. **Normalize to 2NF**:
   ```
   R1(A, B) with A→B
   R2(A, C, D) with AC→AD and C→D
   ```
5. **Check R2 for 3NF**:
   - C→D is transitive dependency (non-key → non-key)
   - **Not in 3NF**
6. **Final Normalized**:
   ```
   R1(A, B) with A→B
   R2(A, C) with AC→AC
   R3(C, D) with C→D
   ```
